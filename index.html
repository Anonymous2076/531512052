									<h3>Your Patience</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Listen, I know I can be hot cancer but this one should be obvious, you put up with my crap and you love me unconditionally. You have such a special place in my heart and I really am grateful for everything you do when you deal with me.</p>

									<h3>Unwavering affection</h3>
								</header>
								<p>This ties into with the other one but seriously, I'd be damned to find literally anyone who's as loving, as caring and as passionate as you are. Seriously, you're so impartial and unchanging in how you feel about me no matter how much of my ugly past I bring up that it'd be a crime if I didn't mention why this makes you the most perfect person ever.</p>

									<h3>You Funny As heeeell</h3>
								</header>
								<p>You may not believe me on this but I'm saying it anyways, you really make me laugh and have a good time. Whenever we chill in the voice chats its always going to end up with me going to bed really happy and with a goofy smile. You're really amazing for being such a bright influence on my life and thats why its up here on my list.</p>

								</header>
								<p>Nothing you can say will convince me otherwise that you ain't smart if you made it to this website. You're cool and collected and even when I freak out you always come up with a good solution to a problem or ways to calm me down enough to think properly.</p>

									<h3>Your Open Mindedness</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Honestly I'm speachless when it comes to this, the level of effort you put into me, into understanding my faith, getting to know me more and my family more, its the greatest thing I have never asked for and you've been more than happy to keep up with me no matter what I put up. Legit I tear up thinking about how someone could be so flexible to go through all those hoops just for my sake and I cannot stress how much I deeply appreciate you and Love you for that. I know I've mentioned this many times but I'm willing to do the same for you if it should ever arise but seriously gils... Thank you so much.</p>

					<h2>100% accurate poem on how much I love you</h2>
					<p>How Do I Love Thee? Let me count the ways. <br>I love thee to the depth and breadth and height <br> My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight <br>For the ends of being and ideal grace. <br>I love thee to the level of every day's <br>Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light. <br>I love thee freely, as men strive for right. <br>I love thee purely, as they turn from praise. <br>I love thee with the passion put to use <br>In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith. <br>I love thee with a love I seemed to lose <br>With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath, <br> Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose, <br> I shall but love thee better after death.</p>
